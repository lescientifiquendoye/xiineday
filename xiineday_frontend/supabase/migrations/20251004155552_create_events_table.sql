  # Create events table for agricultural event planning

  ## Overview
  This migration creates a table to store user-created agricultural events 
  that will be displayed on the calendar interface.

  ## Tables Created
  
  ### events
  - `id` (uuid, primary key) - Unique identifier for each event
  - `title` (text, required) - Name of the event
  - `event_type` (text, required) - Type of agricultural event (e.g., 'Semis', 'RÃ©colte')
  - `location` (text, required) - Geographic location of the event
  - `event_date` (date, required) - Date when the event is scheduled
  - `description` (text, optional) - Additional details about the event
  - `weather_score` (integer, optional) - Weather suitability score (0-100)
  - `created_at` (timestamptz) - Timestamp when the event was created
  - `updated_at` (timestamptz) - Timestamp when the event was last updated

  ## Security
  
  ### Row Level Security (RLS)
  - RLS is enabled on the events table
  - Public read access: Anyone can view events (useful for agricultural calendar sharing)
  - Public write access: Anyone can create events (simplified for demo purposes)
  - Users can update and delete their own events based on session tracking
  
  ## Indexes
  - Index on `event_date` for efficient date-based queries
  - Index on `location` for location-based filtering
